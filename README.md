# AIFinalProject
Preject realized as part of the COMP 424 class at McGill university. The goal was to build an AI that can play pentago swap using any technology available. The AI would have 2 seconds to think between each move at most. 

On my end I tackled the challenge using Monte Carlo as the main algorithm combined with a very simple heuristic to trim each branch
of bad children and increase its interest on promessing children when generating them.  
Combined with that I used the alpha ratio system to estimate the time that each calculation would take as the game advanced in order to better
optimize the search time.

# Results
The grade was calculated based on how well the AI performed against other students AI. Over all **289** students participated in the competition,
my AI ranked **12** which is a performance that I am very satisfied with.
